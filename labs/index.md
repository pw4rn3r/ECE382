## Demos

**You must demo to receive points for functionality!**

If you can't find an instructor, send them an e-mail with the features you were going to demo and your code at that time.  If you want, record a video and send it - that can sometimes suffice for a demonstration (instructor discretion).

## Lab Notebook Standards

See the [Lab Notebooks](/382/admin/labs.html) link on the Admin page.

## Lab notebook instructor access and issue tracker

Do not forget to add your instructor to your Bitbucket repository (Settings --> Access Management --> Users).
You do not need to add all of the instructors.

The current usernames for the 382 instructors are:

- pwarner
- walchko
- GeorgeYork

Also turn on your issue tracker (Settings --> Issue tracker --> select "Private issue tracker" radio box).
